## Configuration Parameters


Some customisation can be performed using configuration parameters outside a Session. For details of other configuration parameters that can be set, and the syntax used to set them, see the Dyalog for <operating system> Installation and Configuration Guide specific to the operating system that you are using.

Changes made to configuration parameters in the dyalog.config file only impact local interpreters (that is, interpreters that are configured by that file) and do not impact interpreters that the RIDE can connect with on other machines.
