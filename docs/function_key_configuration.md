### Function Key Configuration


Character strings (including command keys) can be associated with programmable function keys using the `⎕PFKEY` system function. When running a Dyalog Session through the RIDE, `⎕PFKEY` can be used to define/display the keystrokes for a designated function key; however, that function key does not acquire the defined set of keystrokes, rendering `⎕PFKEY` of no real use. Instead, function keys should be set through the Shortcuts tab of the Preferences dialog box (see [Section ](shortcuts_tab.md#)).
