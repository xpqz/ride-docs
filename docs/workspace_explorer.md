### Workspace Explorer


The workspace explorer is located to the left of the Session window. It contains a hierarchical tree view of all the namespaces, classes, functions, operators and variables in the active workspace (under `#`) and in the system namespace (under `âŽ•SE`).


Double-clicking on a namespace, class, function, operator or variable opens its definition in the Edit window.


Display of the workspace explorer can be toggled with the View > Show Workspace Explorer menu option or by entering the Toggle Workspace Explorer command (<WSE>).
