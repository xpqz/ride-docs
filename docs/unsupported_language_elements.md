## Unsupported Language Elements


When running a Dyalog Session through the RIDE, a few of the features that are available with non-RIDE Sessions do not function as might be expected, for example, [Section ](underscored_characters.md#), [Section ](function_key_configuration.md#) and [Section ](operating_system_interaction.md#).
