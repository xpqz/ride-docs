### Installing on macOS


The RIDE is the default UI for Dyalog on macOS and is installed at the same time as Dyalog (see the Dyalog for macOS Installation and Configuration Guide); no further installation is required.


To install the RIDE as a separate, stand-alone, product

1. Download the RIDE's .pkg file from my.dyalog.com.
2. Double-click on the RIDE's .pkg file.
3. Follow the instructions in the RIDE Installer window to successful completion of the installation process.




Starting the RIDE adds its icon to the dock. To keep the RIDE icon in the dock permanently, right-click on the icon and select Options > Keep in Dock from the drop-down list that appears.
