### Other Keyboard Options


Installing and enabling a set of key mappings allows Dyalog glyphs to be entered in other applications (for example, email). An alternative set of key mappings can also be used to replace the default key mappings for the RIDE.


Information and the requisite downloadable files are available at http://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm.

If you have the Dyalog Unicode IME installed, then the RIDE activates it by default. It can be disabled by unchecking the Also enable Dyalog IME checkbox in the Keyboard tab of the Preferences dialog box (see [Section ](keyboard_tab.md#)).
If Dyalog is not installed on the machine that the RIDE is running on, then the Dyalog Unicode IME can be downloaded and installed from http://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm.

Most Linux distributions released after mid-2012 support Dyalog glyphs by default. For more information, see the Dyalog for UNIX Installation and Configuration Guide.
