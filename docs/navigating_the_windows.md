## Navigating the Windows


When multiple windows are open, the window that has the focus is referred to as the active window. A window can be made the active window by clicking within it.


The Session, Edit and Trace windows form a closed loop for the purpose of navigation:

- to make the next window in this loop the active window, enter the Tab Window command (<TB>)
- to make the previous window in this loop the active window, enter the Back Tab Window command (<BT>)

An active Edit/Trace window can be closed after changes have been made to its content:

- to save any changes in the content of the active window before closing it, enter the Escape command (<EP>), press the  button in its menu bar or, if the window is docked, press  in the window's tab.
- to discard any changes in the content of the active window before closing it, enter the Quit command (<QT>)
