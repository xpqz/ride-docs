### Types


The Type can be one of three options (selected from a drop-down list). The type that is selected determines the content of the type-dependent area. The options are:

- Start – the RIDE initiates and connects with a new local or remote interpreter (see [Section ](type_start.md#))
- Connect – a specific (local or remote) Dyalog interpreter is sought by the RIDE for connection (see [Section ](type_connect.md#))
- Listen – the RIDE waits for a local or remote interpreter to connect to it (see [Section ](type_listen.md#))
