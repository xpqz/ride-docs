### Keyboard Tab


Allows customisation of the default keyboard key mappings for APL glyphs (see [Section ](keyboard_key_mappings_for_apl_glyphs.md#)). This is only relevant if a locale-specific keyboard has not been installed.

To replace the keyboard with a locale-specific keyboard in the Session, or to enter Dyalog glyphs in other applications (for example, email), see http://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm.

            If you have the Dyalog Unicode IME installed, then the RIDE activates it at start-up when the Also enable Dyalog IME (requires RIDE restart) checkbox is selected (selected by default).
            
If Dyalog is not installed on the machine that the RIDE is running on, then the Dyalog Unicode IME can be downloaded and installed from http://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm.

Most Linux distributions released after mid-2012 support Dyalog glyphs by default, for example, openSUSE 12.2, Ubuntu 12.10 and Fedora 17. For more information, see the Dyalog for UNIX Installation and Configuration Guide.

To customise the default keyboard's Prefix key

1. Open the Keyboard tab and select the appropriate keyboard from the drop down list of options.
2. In the Prefix key field, enter the new prefix key (by default this is `).
3. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog box, Apply to save your changes without closing the Preferences dialog box or Cancel to close the Preferences dialog box without saving your changes.




To customise the default keyboard's key mappings

1. Open the Keyboard tab and select the appropriate keyboard from the drop down list of options.
2. In the image of a keyboard, click on the glyph to be replaced (bottom right of the key for unshifted mode and top right of the key for shifted mode).
3. Enter the glyph to replace the selected glyph with.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the key mappings are as required.
5. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog box, Apply to save your changes without closing the Preferences dialog box or Cancel to close the Preferences dialog box without saving your changes.




Your selection of keyboard key mappings is unrestricted â€“ you can choose to map the same glyph to multiple keys or have glyphs that are not represented on the keyboard at all. For example, when dealing with dfns on a Danish keyboard, it might be convenient to map `{` and `}` to a simpler key combination.
