# Input Windows


Instead of just a single Session window, the Dyalog Development Environment can comprise multiple windows:

- Session window – created when a Dyalog Session is started through the RIDE and always present while the Session is live. There is only one Session window. For more information, see [Section ](session_window_input.md#).
- Edit windows – created and destroyed dynamically as required. There can be multiple Edit windows (one for each APL object). For more information, see [Section ](edit_window.md#).
- Trace window – created and destroyed dynamically as required. There is only one Trace window. For more information, see [Section ](trace_window.md#).

When multiple windows are open, the window that has the focus is referred to as the active window.
