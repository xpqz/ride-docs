### Shortcuts Tab


Allows customisation of the keyboard shortcuts for command codes (see [Section ](keyboard_shortcuts_and_command_codes.md#) and [Appendix ](keyboard_shortcuts.md#)). Multiple shortcuts can be defined for any command code, but each shortcut must be unique.


To change the keyboard shortcut for a command code

1. Open the Shortcuts tab.
2. Locate the command code for which you want to define a new keyboard shortcut. This can be done by scrolling through the list of possible command codes or by entering a string in the Search field. If a string is entered in the Search field then a dynamic search of both the command codes and descriptions is performed.
3. Optionally, delete any existing shortcuts for the command by clicking the red cross to the right of the shortcut.
4. Optionally, add a new shortcut. To do this:Click the plus symbol that appears to the right of any existing shortcuts when the shortcut is moused over.
A field in which to enter the shortcut is displayed.
In this field, enter the keystrokes to map to this action. The field closes when the keystrokes have been entered and the new shortcut is displayed on the Shortcuts tab.
If the keystrokes that you enter are already used for a different command code, then both occurrences will be highlighted and you should remove any duplicate entries (an error message will be displayed if you attempt to apply/save settings that contain duplicate entries).

5. Click the plus symbol that appears to the right of any existing shortcuts when the shortcut is moused over.
6. In this field, enter the keystrokes to map to this action. The field closes when the keystrokes have been entered and the new shortcut is displayed on the Shortcuts tab.
7. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog box, Apply to save your changes without closing the Preferences dialog box or Cancel to close the Preferences dialog box without saving your changes.




The tooltip showing keyboard shortcuts for command codes (obtained by positioning the cursor over the  button on the right hand side of the Language bar) is dynamically updated to any customisation.
