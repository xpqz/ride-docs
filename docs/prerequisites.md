## Pre-requisites


RIDE  can only connect to a Dyalog interpreter that is version 15.0 or later.


The RIDE is supported on the following operating systems:

- Linux x86_64 – the following distributions:Debian 8 onwardsFedora 25 onwardsUbuntu 14.04 onwards
distributions built on top of these should also work

(Linux distribution must also have libnss version 3.26 onwards)

- Debian 8 onwards
- Fedora 25 onwards
- Ubuntu 14.04 onwards
- macOS – Yosemite onwards
- Microsoft Windows – Windows 7 onwards

For the zero-footprint RIDE:

- a compatible browser must be installed.
- the operating system must be supported by the underlying technology (see https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v13.4.0/docs/tutorial/support.md).

If Dyalog is not installed on the machine that the RIDE is being installed on, then the APL385 font and keyboard mappings installed with the RIDE mean that they are available when running a Dyalog Session through the RIDE. However, to be able to enter APL glyphs outside a Dyalog Session (for example, in text files or emails) you will need to download and install the appropriate files (files and instructions are available from http://www.dyalog.com/apl-font-keyboard.htm, as is the Dyalog Unicode IME for Microsoft Windows).
