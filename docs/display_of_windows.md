## Display of Windows


By default, the Trace window and Edit windows are docked beneath and to the right of the Session window respectively. If the menu option View > Show Workspace Explorer is checked, then the workspace explorer is docked to the far left of any open windows; if the menu option View > Show Debug is checked, then the debug information window is docked to the far right of any open windows (see [](session_user_interface.md#extendedUIwindows)[Section ](session_user_interface.md#)).


Docked windows can be selected (by clicking within them), resized (by moving the splitter bar) and maximised/minimised (by toggling the icon at the top right of each window).


New Edit and Trace windows can be floating rather than docked by selecting the Floating windows checkbox in the Windows tab of the Preferences dialog box (see [Section ](windows_tab.md#)).


Clicking in the tab of any window enables that window to be dragged to a different location.
