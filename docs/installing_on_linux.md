### Installing on Linux


The installation process for the RIDE is the same irrespective of whether it is installed as a stand-alone product or on a machine that already has Dyalog installed.


To install the RIDE

1. Download the RIDE's .deb or .rpm file (whichever is appropriate for your Linux distribution) from my.dyalog.com. If your Linux distribution does not support either .deb or .rpm files, then please contact support@dyalog.com.
2. From the command line, use standard installation commands to install the package.
