## Session User Interface

The menu bar menu options on macOS are different to those on Microsoft Windows and Linux. This section details the options for Microsoft Windows and Linux; for the macOS options see the Dyalog for macOS UI Guide.
The RIDE's UI can vary slightly across different operating systems (and window managers); in particular, RIDE-specific menu bars can be located either within the development environment or in the global menu bar.

By default, the Dyalog Session user interface includes five elements, as shown in [](#defaultUIwindows):

- a caption (see [Section ](caption.md#))
- a menu bar (see [Section ](menu_bar.md#))
- a Language bar (see [Section ](language_bar.md#))
- a Session window (see [Section ](session_window.md#))
- a Status bar (see [Section ](status_bar.md#))

Additional elements can also be present, as shown in [](#extendedUIwindows):

- a workspace explorer (see [Section ](workspace_explorer.md#))
- a debug information window (see [Section ](debug_information_window.md#))
