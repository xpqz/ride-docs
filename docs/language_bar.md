### Language Bar


The Language bar is located at the top of the Session window, beneath the menu bar. It contains buttons for each of the glyphs used as primitives in Dyalog.


When the cursor is positioned over one of the glyphs, information for that glyph is displayed. This includes the name of the glyph, the keyboard shortcut to enter it, its monadic/dyadic name and examples of its syntax, arguments and result.


Clicking on one of the glyphs copies that glyph into the active Session/Edit window at the position of the input cursor (the same as typing it directly into the Session/Edit window).


The order of glyphs in the Language bar can be customised by using the mouse to drag-and-drop individual glyphs to the required location.


Display of the Language bar can be toggled with the View > Show Language Bar menu option or by entering the Toggle Language bar command (<LBR>).


On the right hand side of the Language bar is the  button:

- Positioning the cursor over the  button displays a dynamic tooltip showing all configured keyboard shortcuts for command codes – for more information on these, see [Section ](keyboard_shortcuts_and_command_codes.md#).
- Clicking on the  button displays the Preferences dialog box (the same as selecting the Edit > Preferences menu option) – for more information on the Preferences dialog box, see [Section ](preferences_dialog_box.md#).
