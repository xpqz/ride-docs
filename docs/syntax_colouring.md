### Syntax Colouring


Applicable in the Edit window and Trace window


Syntax colouring assigns different colours to various components, making them easily identifiable. The default syntax colouring convention used is detailed in [](#syntaxcolouring)below.

| Colour | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
|  | black | global names session input/output (unless specified elsewhere) |
|  | grey | names namespaces numbers tradfn syntax (header line and final `∇` in scripted syntax) |
|  | maroon | control structure keywords |
|  | red | errors (including unmatched parentheses, quotes and braces) |
|  | teal | strings comments |
|  | navy | primitive functions zilde |
|  | blue | idioms (this takes priority over any other syntax colouring) operators parentheses/braces/brackets dfn syntax (specifically, `{ } ⍺ ⍵ ∇` and `:` ) assignment ( `←` ), diamond ( `⋄` ) and semi-colon ( `;` ) |
|  | purple | system names |


The foreground colour and/or the background colour (highlighting) can be customised by syntax type – see [Section ](colours_tab.md#).
