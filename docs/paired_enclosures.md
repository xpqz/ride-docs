### Paired Enclosures


Applicable in the Session window and the Edit window


Enclosures in the RIDE include:

- parentheses `( )`
- braces `{ }`
- brackets `[ ]`

Angle brackets `< >` are not enclosures.


When an opening enclosure character is entered, the RIDE automatically includes its closing pair. This reduces the risk of an invalid expression being entered due to unbalanced enclosures. This feature can be disabled in the General tab of the Preferences dialog box (see [Section ](general_tab.md#)).
