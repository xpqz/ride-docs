### Zero Footprint


The use of the RIDE from a browser requires no installation on the machine where the RIDE will run. However, the RIDE must be installed on the machine where APL is installed, so that Dyalog can act as a web server, making the necessary files available to the browser.

When installing the RIDE, if you select the default location suggested by the installer then APL can be launched as a RIDE server without creating a configuration file (see [Appendix ](sample_configuration_file.md#)).

On non-Windows platforms, the Zero Footprint RIDE is automatically installed to the default location ([DYALOG]/RIDEapp) when Dyalog is installed and no additional installation is necessary to use the Zero Footprint RIDE from a browser â€“ see [Section 1.1](the_zero_footprint_ride.md#).
