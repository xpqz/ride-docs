# The Dyalog Development Environment


When a Dyalog Session is started through the RIDE, the Dyalog development environment is displayed. This means that:

- the Dyalog Session user interface is displayed (see [Section ](session_user_interface.md#))
- the keyboard key mappings for APL glyphs are enabled (see [Section ](keyboard_key_mappings_for_apl_glyphs.md#))
