### Exiting the Trace Window


To close the Trace window:

- click  in the Trace window's tab
- click  in the Trace window's toolbar
- use the Escape command (<EP>)
- use the Quit command (<QT>)
- press the Esc key

When the Trace window is closed, the function within that Trace window is removed from the stack. It is possible to close all Trace/Edit windows without clearing the stack by selecting the Window > Close All Windows menu option or using `2023‚å∂` (for information on this I-beam, see the Dyalog APL Language Reference Guide).
