### Saved Responses Tab


Allows saved option selections to be deleted.


When using Link, options selected in dialog boxes are recorded in this tab. For example, saving file content opens a dialog box that offers options of fixing as code in the workspace, saving the file to disk, or discarding changes; the selected option for this file (or, optionally, all files with the same file extension) is recorded in this tab.


To delete a previously-saved option selection for a file

1. Open the Saved Responses tab.
2. Select the file for which you want to delete the saved option.
3. Click Delete.
4. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog box, Apply to save your changes without closing the Preferences dialog box or Cancel to close the Preferences dialog box without saving your changes.
