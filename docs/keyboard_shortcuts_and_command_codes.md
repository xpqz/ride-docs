## Keyboard Shortcuts and Command Codes


Keyboard shortcuts are keystrokes that execute an action rather than produce a symbol. The RIDE supports numerous keyboard shortcuts, each of which is identified by a command code and mapped to a keystroke combination; for example, the action to open the Trace window  is identified by the code TC (described in the documentation as <TC>). For a complete list of the command codes that can be used in a Dyalog Session running through the RIDE and the keyboard shortcuts for those command codes, see [Appendix ](keyboard_shortcuts.md#).


Positioning the cursor over the  button on the right hand side of the Language bar displays a dynamic tooltip showing all configured keyboard shortcuts for command codes. Clicking on the  button displays the Preferences dialog box (the same as selecting the Edit > Preferences menu option), through which keyboard shortcuts can be customised (see [Section ](shortcuts_tab.md#)).
