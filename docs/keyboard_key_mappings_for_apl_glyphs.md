## Keyboard Key Mappings for APL Glyphs


A set of keyboard key mappings for APL glyphs is installed with the RIDE. When the RIDE is the active application, these key mappings are automatically enabled. The RIDE attempts to identify a user's locale and use the appropriate key mappings; if the locale cannot be identified or the locale-specific key mappings have not been configured, then the default configuration is used (key mappings for a US keyboard).


Using this set of key mappings, APL glyphs are entered by pressing the prefix key followed by either the appropriate key or the SHIFT key with the appropriate key. The prefix key and key mappings can be customised (see [Section ](keyboard_tab.md#)).
