### Title Tab


Allows customisation of the caption at the top of the Session (see [Section ](caption.md#)).


To change the caption

1. Open the Title tab.
2. In the Window title field, enter the new name for the Session. Some variable options that can be included are listed beneath this field – clicking on these inserts them into the Window title field.
3. Click OK to save your changes and close the Preferences dialog box, Apply to save your changes without closing the Preferences dialog box or Cancel to close the Preferences dialog box without saving your changes.




The default value is `{CAPTION}`, which is the same as `{WSID}` by default.


Changing this to `{WSID} – {HOST}:{PORT} (PID: {PID})` gives a different result on every machine. For example:


/Users/nick/myws.dws – 127.0.0.1:4502 (PID: 293)


Changing this to `{CHARS} {BITS}` gives information that could be the same on multiple machines. For example:


Unicode 64
