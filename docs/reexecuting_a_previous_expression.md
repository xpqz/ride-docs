### Re-executing a Previous Expression


Applicable in the Session window


Instead of entering a new expression in the input line, you can move back through the Session log and re-execute a previously-entered expression.


To re-execute a previously-entered expression

1. Locate the expression to re-execute in one of the following ways:- Scroll back through the Session log.
- Use the Backward command (<BK>) and the Forward command (<FD>) to cycle backwards and forwards through the input history, successively copying previously-entered expressions into the input line.
2. Position the cursor anywhere within the expression that you want to re execute and press the Enter key or use the Enter command (<ER>).




If required, a previously-entered expression can be amended prior to execution. In this situation, when the amended expression is executed it is copied to the input line; the original expression in the Session log is not changed. If you start to edit a previous expression and then decide not to, use the Quit command (<QT>) to return the previous expression to its unaltered state.
