# Customising Your Session


The appearance and behaviour of a Dyalog Session running through the RIDE can be customised to meet personal preferences and corporate guidelines. Configuration can be performed:

- through the View menu – see [Section ](view_menu_customisation.md#)
- through the Preferences dialog box – see [Section ](preferences_dialog_box.md#)
- using configuration parameters – see [Section ](configuration_parameters.md#)

Customisations performed using any of these methods persist between Sessions (they also persist when the installed version of Dyalog is upgraded).

To remove all customisations, reset all RIDE-specific settings and return to the initial default settings, rename/delete the following directory:- Linux: $HOME/.config/Ride-<version>
- macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/Ride-<version>(hidden directory – access from the command line)
- Microsoft Windows: %APPDATA%\Ride-<version>
