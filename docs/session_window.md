### Session Window


The primary purpose of the Session window is to provide a scrolling area within which a user can enter APL expressions and view results. See [Section ](session_window_input.md#) for more information on the Session window.


You can move, resize, maximise and minimise the Session window using the standard facilities provided by your operating system.
