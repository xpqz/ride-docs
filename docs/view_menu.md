The options available under the View menu are detailed in [](#view_menu)below. These enable the appearance of the Dyalog Session to be changed.

| Show Language Bar | Toggles display of the Language bar (see [Section ](language_bar.md#) ) at the top of the Session window. |
| Show Status bar | Toggles display of the Status bar (see [Section ](status_bar.md#) ) at the bottom of the Session window. |
