# RIDE-Specific Language Features


When running a Dyalog Session through the RIDE, the majority of language features remain unaltered. However, there are a few additional features (see [Section ](ibeams.md#) and [Section ](configuration_parameters_ridespecific.md#)) and some existing functionality that is meaningless (see [Section ](unsupported_language_elements.md#) ) when a Session is running through the RIDE.
