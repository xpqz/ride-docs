### Menu Tab


Allows customisation of the menu options in the menu bar (see [Section ](menu_bar.md#)).



Great care should be taken when customising the menu options; although the ability to make changes is provided, it is not an activity that Dyalog Ltd supports.


If menu options are customised, then updates to menu items are ignored when updating the installed version of RIDE (this can be avoided by resetting the menu options before upgrading RIDE).



Top-level options (menu names in the menu bar) can be:

- created
- renamed
- reordered
- deleted

Options within each of the menus can be:

- moved to be under a different menu name in the menu bar
- reordered under the same menu name in the menu bar
- renamed
- deleted

Changes do not take effect until the next time a Dyalog Session is started through the RIDE.
