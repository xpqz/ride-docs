## I-Beams


I-Beam is a monadic operator that provides a range of system-related services.


Syntax: `R←{X}(A⌶)Y`

Any service provided using an I-Beam should be considered as experimental and subject to change – without notice – from one release to the next. Any use of I-Beams in applications should, therefore, be carefully isolated in cover-functions that can be adjusted if necessary.

There are three I-Beams that are only relevant to the RIDE: [Section ](3500_ibeam_ride.md#), [Section ](3501_ibeam_ride.md#) and [Section ](3502_ibeam_ride.md#).
